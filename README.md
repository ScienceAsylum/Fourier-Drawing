# Fourier-Drawing
This code is for drawing shapes with a Fourier series. It works fine for a small number of terms, but runs incredibly slow for a large number of terms. I'm not sure how to make it more efficient. It also has trouble near the ends of the path if the path doesn't close on itself, but I think that's just the nature of Fourier series.
